== Release Instructions

=== Done manually on local development machines until we have this on a parameterized CI build

Let Maven do component upgrades and version bumping.  Replace the `tag`, `developmentVersion`, and `releaseVersion` parameters as necessary.  Please keep tags to form `vX` where `v` is always a `v` and `X` is the release number.
```
mvn release:prepare release:clean -DdevelopmentVersion=2-SNAPSHOT -DreleaseVersion=1 -Dtag=v1
```

Check out the tag locally
```
git checkout -b vX refs/tags/vX
```

Build and deploy docker image to Docker Hub (requires permissions)
```
mvn clean install
docker build -t openshiftio/launcher-backend:vX -f Dockerfile.deploy .
docker push openshiftio/launcher-backend:vX
```
