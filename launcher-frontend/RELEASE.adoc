== Release Instructions

=== Done manually on local development machines until we have this on a parameterized CI build

Let Maven do component upgrades and version bumping.  Replace the `tag`, `developmentVersion`, and `releaseVersion` parameters as necessary.  Please keep tags to form `vX` where `v` is always a `v` and `X` is the release number.

Tag and checkout into a branch 
```
git tag vX
git checkout -b vX refs/tags/vX
```

Build and deploy docker image to Docker Hub (requires permissions)
```
npm run build:prod
docker build -t openshiftio/launchpad-frontend:vX -f Dockerfile.deploy .
docker push openshiftio/launchpad-frontend:vX
```

All's good?  Push the Git tag.
```
git checkout master
git push upstream master --tags
```
