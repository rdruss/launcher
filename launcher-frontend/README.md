If you trying to refresh your install you can run:

```bash
$ npm run reinstall

Start the app by executing the following.

## Production Build

Location of the [backend][2] can be determained at runtime (via `settings.json`) or at build time.
If `LAUNCHPAD_BACKEND_URL` environment variable is set at build time, this value will be used to connect to the backend.
Otherwise [settings.json][1] will be fetched at runtime and the contents used connect to the backend.

To generate production build, set the backend url (the host and port of where
[generator backend][2] is deployed) either in the [settings.json][1] or as `LAUNCHPAD_BACKEND_URL` environment variable
and run the `npm` command as given below:

```bash
npm run build:prod
```

The build output will be under `dist` directory.
