    Welcome to the Launchpad

  <div class="lead">
    <p>
      You are moments away from continuous delivery of a new application,
      built and deployed on the OpenShift cloud platform.

      Here we'll help you:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Choose your Mission, an initial goal like "open up an HTTP endpoint" or "interact with a database".</li>
      <li>Select a Runtime, one of <a href="http://vertx.io/" target="eclipsevertx">Eclipse Vert.x</a> for asynchronous and
        reactive development, <a href="http://wildfly-swarm.io/" target="wildflyswarm">WildFly Swarm</a> for Microservices with Java EE,
        or <a href="https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/" target="springboot">Spring Boot</a> for opinionated, standalone Spring applications.</li>
      <li>Access your Booster, a fully-functioning starter application which will be live and available in minutes.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Along the way we'll (with your permission!) push the Booster into your GitHub namespace, set up a build pipeline for
      continuous delivery, and ensure it's triggered to run on each push to your git remote.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's get you into orbit.
