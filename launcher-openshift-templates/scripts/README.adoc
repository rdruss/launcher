== Utility Scripts
:idprefix: id_ 
Two scripts to remove some of the boring manual work.
        
=== Creating the unified template

To create the unified template just run the following command without arguments:

[source,bash]
----
    ./create-unified-template.sh > ../openshift/launcher-template.yaml
----

For this script to work it's required to have the other launcher projects (launcher-backend and launcher-frontend) cloned in the same folder as this project.

=== Creating the S2I support files

To ready a Booster project for use with the S2I-based Launcher run the following script in the root of the booster without arguments:

[source,bash]
----
    ..../create-launch-templates.sh
----

Read the output of the command carefully and if everything seems okay commit the files that it has generated to the Booster's Git repository.

=== Starting the Launcher using Docker

If you quickly want to run the Launcher on an unprepared system (Docker required) you can run the following script:

[source,bash]
----
    ..../run-launcher.sh (minishift|keycloak|stop|help)
----

You can start it either with `minishift` if you have a locally running Minishift instance or `keycloak` if you want to connect to the official Launcher keycloak server. If you're finished you can run the script again with `stop` to stop and remove the Docker containers.
