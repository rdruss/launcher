:idprefix: id_ 
The OpenShift templates that will create all the necessary services to run the Launcher
        
== Setup

To install this template in your OpenShift project run the following:

[source,bash]
----
    oc create -f openshift/launcher-template.yaml
----

Or go the the OpenShift web console, select `Import YAML / JSON`, copy & paste the contents of https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fabric8-launcher/launcher-openshift-templates/master/openshift/launcher-template.yaml[launcher-template.yaml] into the text box and click `Create`.

By default this creates a new Launcher application containing the latest version of both the https://hub.docker.com/r/fabric8/launcher-frontend/[frontend] and https://hub.docker.com/r/fabric8/launcher-backend/[backend] services as found on Docker Hub.

== Addon

We provide an addon to load this template in the OpenShift/MiniShift catalog. Just copy the `addons` directory to your `~/.minishift/addons` as explained here: https://docs.openshift.org/latest/minishift/using/addons.html
